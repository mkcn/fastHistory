A python tool connected to your terminal to store important commands, search them in a fast way and automatically paste them into your terminal

# Intro
### Why you need it?

How often do you need to reuse a command but you cannot remember it (or all the needed options/flags)?

```sh
# example of a common but not so 'easy-to-remember' bash command from my bash history
$ tar -xvzf file.tar.gz
```

How many times do you search the same commands on Google, over and over? 

> 42 times..  yes..  based on my experience the answer is [42](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/42-the-answer-to-life-the-universe-and-everything-2205734.html)


And how many times have you told yourself to store this *super* useful command but you didn't? 

> I saved them all ..totally, with a good and detailed explanation for each command

if you know what I am talking about, **fastHistory** is the tool you are looking for!


### Usage sample

**fastHistory** can save your commands directly from your terminal, all you need is a **#**

```sh
$ tar -xvzf file.tar.gz #
                       /\
                        \-- fastHistory will store 'tar -xvzf file.tar.gz' in its internal database
```

You can specify one or more **tags**


```sh
$ tar -xvzf file.tar.gz #untar #extract #archive 
```

or a **description**

```sh
$ tar -xvzf file.tar.gz #@extract compressed files from archive
```

or **both**

```sh
$ tar -xvf archive.tar.gz #untar @extract compressed files from archive
```

To search the saved commands, all you need is **f**
and the selected command wiil be **automatically pasted** into your terminal!

```sh
$ f
```

For each command you can get a quick summary from the man page

**Warning**: this feature currently does not cover the syntax of all commands

![](https://github.com/mkcn/fastHistory/raw/pip/images/man_page.png)

And easily edit the tag and description fields

![](https://github.com/mkcn/fastHistory/raw/pip/images/edit_tag.gif)

Furthermore, you can easily export/import all data to make __backups__ or to share your commands with a different machine

```sh
$ f --export
$ f --import fastHistory_2020-03-02.db
```

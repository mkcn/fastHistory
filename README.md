**fastHistory** allows you to store, search and automatically paste all your important commands, plus all the [TDLR](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) command examples, directly in your terminal, with a **new and faster way**!

![fh_main](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7307955/147797297-5a30cc72-b1c8-4527-8c7d-820d18098bc2.gif)

# Intro
### Why you need it?

How often do you need to reuse a command but you cannot remember it (with all the needed options/flags)?

```sh
# example of a common but not so 'easy-to-remember' bash command from my bash history
$ tar -xvzf file.tar.gz
```

How many times do you search the same commands on Google, over and over? 

> 42 times..  yes..  based on my experience the answer is [42](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/42-the-answer-to-life-the-universe-and-everything-2205734.html)


And how many times have you told yourself to store this *super* useful command but you didn't? 

> I saved them all ..totally, with a good and detailed explanation for each command

if you know what I am talking about, **fastHistory** is the tool you are looking for!


### Usage sample

**fastHistory** can save your commands directly from your terminal, all you need is a **#**

```sh
$ tar -xvzf file.tar.gz #
                       /\
                        \-- fastHistory will store 'tar -xvzf file.tar.gz' in its local database
```

You can specify one or more **tags**


```sh
$ tar -xvzf file.tar.gz #untar #extract #archive 
```

or a **description**

```sh
$ tar -xvzf file.tar.gz #@extract compressed files from archive
```

or **both**

```sh
$ tar -xvf archive.tar.gz #untar @extract compressed files from archive
```

To search the saved commands, all you need is **f**
and the selected command wiil be **automatically pasted** into your terminal!

```sh
$ f
```

For each stored command you can get a quick summary from the man page

**note**: this feature does not cover the syntax of all commands

![man page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7307955/147991707-45d8376c-8dd8-4c95-b5c6-5fd959b8cb2b.png)


And easily edit the tag and description fields

![edit description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7307955/147991818-a99795f0-d701-4d3e-b916-bec48852a2f4.png)


Furthermore, you can easily export/import all data to make __backups__ or to share your commands with a different machine

```sh
$ f --export
$ f --import fastHistory_2020-03-02.db
```

### Discover new commands 

With the new [TDLR-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) integration, which contains more than 2500 different commands, you can discover, search and select ready-to-use command examples!

Moreover, the **+** icon shows you which command is already installed on your system 

![discover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7307955/147991558-6f117139-da45-4494-91d4-1dc59971a473.png)

**FastHistory** does not need any internet connection, so **you can use it also offline**!
